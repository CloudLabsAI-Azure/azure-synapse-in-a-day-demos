## About Principal Component Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) is by far the most commonly used dimension reduction algorithm in machine learning.

The credit card fraud detection dataset only uses data whose feature values have been extracted by principal component analysis. It is considered inappropriate to provide the original features and more background information about the raw data that contains things like the individual's name, the store name and the purchased product(s) in the credit card transaction, due to personal information protection issues associated with GDPR that came into effect in May 2017.

Principal component analysis is a common algorithm that is also available in Azure ML Studio.

## Machine Learning Algorithm Used for Scoring in Exercise 1

The machine learning algorithm that we will use in Exercise 1 to do the scoring by calling the learned model from T-SQL will be the linear regression algorithm from Python's `scikit-learn` machine learning library.

Linear regression is a machine learning model that predicts response variables from the values of explanatory variables using a regression equation.

`scikit-learn` contains `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` as the class for making predictions based on linear regression. We will use this as the algorithm for the machine learning model prepared for this hands-on training scenario.

To deploy a model in `scikit-learn` format in an SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics Studio, you must convert it to an ONNX-format model. For more details, visit [http://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/index.html](http://onnx.ai/sklearn-onnx/index.html).

Azure Synapse Analytics Studio also offers libraries other than scikit-learn that support conversion to the ONNX model. For more details, visit [https://github.com/onnx/tutorials#converting-to-onnx-format](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials#converting-to-onnx-format).

In this hands-on training, we'll use T-SQL to score an ONNX-format machine learning model that has been developed and trained with scikit-learn by deploying it in a SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics Studio.
